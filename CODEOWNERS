# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repository.
# Unless a later match takes precedence,
# they will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.

# See documentation here: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#example-of-a-codeowners-file
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
